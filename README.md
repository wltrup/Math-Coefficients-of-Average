# Coefficients of Average

Given a set of real positive numbers, how does one find a corresponding set of weights so that the weighted average of the given numbers equals a given value?

Of course, there are infinitely many solutions to this problem but there is a *unique* solution that minimizes the sum of the squares of the weights.
